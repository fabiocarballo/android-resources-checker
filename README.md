## What

This program will inspect the resources of your app and help you understand which ones are not being used and could
potentially be removed.

Main features:

- Identify the unused resources in your android project.
- Identify the unused resources in your android library (when you have a multi-repo setup)
- Listing of the unused resources (name, type and size)
- Deletion of the unused resources

## Using

This program requires Python, supporting from 3.8.X and 3.9.x

## Inspecting your app resources.

Imagining your app in the project `subject-app`, you can trigger the resources inspection by running:

```shell
make standard-inspection --app-path=/path/to/subject-app
```
